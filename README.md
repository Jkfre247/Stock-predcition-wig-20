## Introduction
The objective of this project is to gain practical experience with prediction algorithms. I apologize in advance, as there may be some mistakes in the implementation of the algorithms. I have chosen local stocks from the WIG20 (the 20 largest companies in Poland) to learn new algorithms for predicting prices. Data was collected from Yahoo Finance.
## Data Cleaning and Data visualisation
First, I removed null and duplicate values. I cleaned the data of errors (extremely high values) and calculated alternative values based on the difference between other stock value columns ("High", "Low", "Close"). After that, I created several charts and functions to display them. Functions were designed to group by specific categories, in this case, the price. I created additional columns, including RSI, MA_Volume_10, SMA_10, Volatility, Daily Range, and Price Change, and saved the cleaned data.
